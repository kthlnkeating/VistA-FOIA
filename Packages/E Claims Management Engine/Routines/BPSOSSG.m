 Q

EMPL ;Get employer info
 ; This by GET logic in BPS NCPDP Field Defs for field 315 (Employer Name)
 ; DMB 11/13/2006 - It makes some sense to only set these fields if
 ;   they exist on the payer sheet.  However, it assumes that the
 ;   employer name field will always be before the other fields and
 ;   that the other fields will not exist without the Employer Name
 ;   field.  For now, leave this be as these fields are on the
 ;   Worker's Comp segment, which we do not do.  We may want to evaluate
 ;   if we were to ever add the Worker's Comp segment
