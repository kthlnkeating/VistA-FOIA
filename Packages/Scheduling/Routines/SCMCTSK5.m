 Q
FLAG ;
 ;;Patients scheduled for inactivation from their Primary Care team and
 ;;Primary Care Provider assignments appear below.
 ;;  
 ;;Flagging of primary care patients from a PCMM panel occurs each time
 ;;this Inactivation Task is run.
 ;;All providers assigned to a particular position are evaluated.  
 ;;If a patient is assigned to PC position and a provider assigned to that
 ;;position has a preceptor all encounters for that patient will be
 ;;checked for matches with either the provider (preceptee) assigned to
 ;;that position or the provider (preceptor) assigned as preceptor to that
 ;;position. If a patient is assigned to the PC preceptor position then only
 ;;the encounters with the provider assigned as preceptor will be evaluated.
 ;;(a) If a patient is NEW as assigned to the position 12 months or less,
 ;;and it is the 11th month since being assigned to the position,
 ;;and the patient had no prior encounters with the PCP/APs in the preceding
 ;;11 months + 7 days then the patient is flagged for inactivation.
 ;;(b) If a patient is ESTABLISHED as assigned to the position more than
 ;;12 months and if the patient had no prior encounters with the PCP/AP in
 ;;the preceding 23 months + 7 days the patient is flagged for inactivation.
 ;;Inactivation will occur on the fifteenth and the last day of the month
 ;;unless the patient has a completed appointment encounter with their current
 ;;Primary Care Provider (PCP) or their Associate Primary Care Provider (AP)
 ;;before that date. The patient may be reactivated to their previous PCP and PC
 ;;team if they return for care.
 ;;This message is generated each time when at least one new occurrence of
 ;;flagging for inactivation takes place, and unconditionally on the 15th and
 ;;the last day of a month.

EXT ;
 ;;By using the Extend Patient Inactivation Date option, these patients'
 ;;PCMM inactivation dates are now 60 days from their original inactivation date.
 ;;Inactivation occurs on the fifteenth and the last day of the month, unless
 ;;the patient has a completed appointment encounter with their current
 ;;Primary Care Provider (PCP) or their Associate Primary Care Provider (AP)
 ;;before that date. The patient may be reactivated to their previous PCP and PC
 ;;team if they return for care.

 Q
INACT ;
 ;;Patients inactivated from their Primary Care team and Primary Care Provider
 ;;assignments appear below.
 ;;Inactivation occurs on the fifteenth and the last day of a month, unless
 ;;the patient has a completed appointment encounter with their current
 ;;Primary Care Provider (PCP) or their Associate Primary Care Provider (AP)
 ;;before that date.
 ;;Inactivation of primary care patients from a PCMM panel occurs under
 ;;the following circumstances:
 ;;(a) The patient expires
 ;;(b) Newly assigned patients (either newly-enrolled patients or patients who
 ;;have been re-assigned to a different provider) who have not been seen by
 ;;their PCP or Associate Provider (AP) and 12 months have passed since the 
 ;;time of assignment to that provider.  This provides every PCP a 1-year grace
 ;;period for seeing patients added to their panel (either newly-enrolled
 ;;patients or patients transferred from a different panel) before they are
 ;;inactivated. Patients must be seen by their PCP or AP within 12 months +7 days
 ;;of being assigned, or they need to be inactivated from the PCP's panel.
 ;;(c) Established patients that have been assigned to the PCP's panel for more 
 ;;than 12 months, but have not been seen by their PCP or AP in the past
 ;;24 months +7 days need to be inactivated.
 ;;The patient may be reactivated to their previous PCP and PC team if they
 ;;return for care.
